# BrainForm ðŸŽ®ðŸ§ 

**BrainForm** is a serious game developed using **Unity 2022.3** that integrates the native package for the **Unicorn EEG** device to create a gamified **Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)** training system. It is designed for scalable data collection using a minimal, wearable hardware setup.

---

## ðŸ§© About the Project

BrainForm is structured as a **2D platformer** featuring:

- A **tutorial level** introducing players to a simplified version of the experimental BCI tasks.
- A **main level** that contains the complete task sequence for gameplay-based EEG training and evaluation.

The game uses **free visual assets** from the Unity Asset Store and supports real-time EEG signal processing, quality estimation, and classification through the Unicorn package's native features.

---

## ðŸ§  Core BCI Features

- Integration with **Unicorn EEG device** via native Unity package.
- Signal quality estimation and configurable BCI processing pipeline.
- Proprietary **LDA classifier** for online EEG-based control.
- Real-time feedback loop and logging for research-grade data collection.

---

## ðŸ§ª Research Context

BrainForm was designed to explore two main questions:

1. **How do users develop BCI control skills** over repeated gameplay sessions?
2. **What are the perceptual and performance-related impacts** of two different visual stimulation textures (with a focus on visual fatigue)?

### Key Findings

- **No significant performance differences** between stimulation textures.
- **Visual fatigue increased** with session count, notably in ocular irritation.
- **Positive user experience** indicated by the Game Experience Questionnaire (GEQ), especially in:
  - Flow
  - Positive Affect
  - Challenge
- **Online performance metrics confirmed learning effects** across sessions:
  - Improved **Task Accuracy**
  - Reduced **Task Time**
  - Increased **Information Transfer Rate (ITR)**

## ðŸ“Š Experimental Setup

- Within-subject design
- Multiple gameplay runs
- Two BCI tasks of varying complexity
- Post-session self-report questionnaires
